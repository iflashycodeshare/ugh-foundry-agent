# uhg-provider-network-agent

An **agent-enabled workspace** with built-in governance, ring lifecycle, and multi-tier team structures.

> **⚠️ Governance scaffold — not a compliance guarantee (RAI-O1).** This template provisions governance *structure* — agents, ring gates, decision logs, and review prompts — to help you run a disciplined process. It does **not**, on its own, guarantee that AI-assisted output is correct, safe, secure, or compliant. Scaffolded artifacts are only as reliable as the human review behind them: you remain accountable for validating every decision, gate approval, and release. Treat generated governance files as prompts for judgment, not evidence of it.

## Quick Start

1. Open in VS Code
2. Use the Agent Workspace sidebar
3. Follow the Ring development lifecycle (Ring-0 through Ring-5)
