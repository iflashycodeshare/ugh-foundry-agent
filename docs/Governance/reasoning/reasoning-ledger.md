### RSN-001: Workspace Tier Selection

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | RSN-001 |
| **Ring** | Ring-0 |
| **Date** | 2026-08-28 |
| **Trigger** | Decision |
| **Related** | DEC-001 |

**Question:** Which workspace tier best matches this project’s team structure and governance needs?

**Constraints considered:**
- Team size and coordination overhead
- Compliance and governance requirements
- Available tooling and automation

**Trade-offs evaluated:**
- Tier 1 (Small Team): Minimal ceremony vs. limited governance depth — rejected (team needs more structure)
- Tier 2 (Multi-Project Team): Balanced governance vs. moderate overhead — rejected (insufficient for program scale)
- Tier 3 (Enterprise Program Office): Full governance suite vs. significant ceremony — selected

**Reasoning:** Tier 3 was selected to match the project’s team structure and compliance posture.

**Assumptions:**
- Team structure and compliance requirements remain stable for the project duration

**Invalidation criteria:** Team grows beyond tier capacity; compliance requirements change; governance overhead becomes disproportionate to value.

**Outcome:** → DEC-001
