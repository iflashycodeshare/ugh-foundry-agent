# Lattice API Audit Log

> Append-only, hash-chained record of every Lattice **runtime API call** made by
> this workspace. Machine-written — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. Each row chains to the previous
> via the `Prev`/`This` SHA-256 columns; any edit, reorder, or deletion breaks the chain
> and is detectable by `verifyAuditChain`. Human/agent narrative belongs in the operating
> guide (`docs/Operations/lattice-integration.md`), not here.
