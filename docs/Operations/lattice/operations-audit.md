# Lattice Operations Audit Log

> Append-only, hash-chained record of local Lattice **governance operations** (configure,
> register, ingest-manifest, live-proof, memory-package) performed by the extension. Machine-written
> — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. Each row chains to the previous via the `Prev`/`This` SHA-256 columns; any
> edit, reorder, or deletion breaks the chain and is detectable. Human/agent narrative belongs in the
> operating guide (`docs/Operations/lattice-integration.md`), not here.
